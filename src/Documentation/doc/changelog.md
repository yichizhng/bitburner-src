## v2.3.0 - SF3 rework and performance improvements (25 May 2023)

BREAKING CHANGES: These changes may require changes to your scripts.

- Major changes to the SF3 mechanic. See the related section below for more detailed info on the changes.
- The same script filename can now be ran multiple times with the same args. If running a script from another script (ns.run/ns.exec/etc), this limitation can be re-imposed with the preventDuplicates RunOption (see general section for info on RunOptions).
- The same .js script will now be the same js module whether the script was ran directly or used as an import. This means top-level variables (variables defined outside of any function) are shared across all instances of the script.
- The js module for a script will also be reused by any script that has the exact same compiled text, even if that script is on another server or has a different filename. This can lead to unexpected results when using top-level variables.
- Some properties removed from ns.getPlayer and added to a separate function ns.getResetInfo. These are still accessible from getPlayer but will produce a warning message the first time they are accessed per game session.
- hackAnalyzeThreads now returns -1, instead of 0, when no money can be hacked from the targeted server.
- ns.iKnowWhatImDoing has been removed, replaced by ns.tprintRaw for printing custom react content to the terminal (limited support).

PERFORMANCE:

- Minimize impact of unavoidable memory leak when modules are created, by reusing modules as much as possible (@d0sboots)
- Internal data structure changes (@d0sboots, @Snarling)
- Fix memory leak when initializing large number of netscript ports (@Snarling)
- Improve performance while on the Active Scripts page if many scripts are starting/ending. (@d0sboots)

NETSCRIPT GENERAL:

- Remove requirement for script args to be unique. This was also related to performance improvements. (@d0sboots)
- ns.hackAnalyzeThreads no longer indicates infinity any time a single thread would hack less than \$1 (@Snarling)
- ns.renamePurchasedServer no longer crashes if player is connected to the server being renamed (@Snarling)
- ns.hackAnalyzeThreads now return -1 (instead of 0) if no money can be hacked from the targeted server. (@d0sboots)
- Fix a possible infinite atExit loop if a script killed itself. (@Snarling)
- Static timestamps of last resets can be obtained via ns.getResetInfo, replacing playtimeSinceLastX from ns.getPlayer (@G4mingJon4s)
- Improved support for printing react content directly to the terminal (ns.tprintRaw) or to a script log (ns.printRaw).
- Added RunOptions, which can optionally replace the "threads" argument for ns.run/ns.exec/ns.spawn. (@d0sboots)
  - RunOptions.threads: Provide a thread count (since RunOptions can replace the threads argument)
  - RunOptions.temporary: Prevents the script execution from being included in the save file.
  - RunOptions.ramOverride: Provide a static ram cost for the script to override what is calculated by the game. Dynamic ram checking is still enforced.
  - RunOptions.preventDuplicates: Fail to launch the script if the args are identical to a script already running.

GENERAL / MISC:

- Fixed a bug that could cause the overview skill bars to become desynced (@d0sboots)

PLANNED 2.3 BREAKING CHANGES:

- 2.3 will include a large planned rework to corporation. This may cause api breaks for any corporation scripts, and there will be large changes in how the corporation mechanic functions.

NETSCRIPT API:

- Added ns.formatNumber, ns.formatRam, and ns.formatPercent, which allow formatting these types of numbers the same way the game does (@Snarling, See UI section).
- Deprecated ns.nFormat. Likely to be removed in 2.3. Now just directly wraps numeral.format (@Snarling)
- EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE (may be reverted next patch): BasicHGWOptions now allows specifying a number of additionalMsec. This should allow easier and more reliable coordination
  of completion times for hack, grow, and weaken. Since this is an experimental change, be prepared for a possible API break next patch if you use this functionality. (@d0sboots)

- Corporation API:

  - Fix bugs with ns.corporation.setAutoJobAssignment. (@zerbosh and @croy)

- Formulas API:

  - Added ns.formulas.hacking.growThreads function (@d0sboots)

  - Added ns.sleeve.setToIdle function (@Zelow79)

- Unsupported API:

  - Added ns.printRaw - allows printing custom React content to script logs. Use at your own risk, misuse is very likely to cause a crash. (@d0sboots)

ELECTRON (STEAM) VERSION:

- Fix security issue where player scripts were allowed to access any part of the player's filesystem. Now access is limited to the game's 'dist' folder. (@Snarling)

SCRIPTS:

- Fix an issue where multiple copies of the same script could be launched with same args/same server (@Mughur)
- Followup changes to API wrapping from 2.2.1 changes. (@d0sboots)

UI:

- Add new number formatting code to replace internal use of unmaintained package numeral.js. Added several Numeric Display options. (@Snarling)
- Removed ingame donation section. (@hydroflame)

## v2.2.1 Hotfixes

Hotfix / bugfix:

- (@d0sboots) Implemented a new API wrapping solution that prevents the need for binding functions to ns when placing them in a new variable, but maintains and perhaps improves upon the performance gains from the previous v2.2.0 changes.
- Fixed some issues with savegames failing to load, or causing the main engine loop to stall after load.
- Fixed an issue where .script files were not receiving the correct args when ran
- Fixed an issue with sleeve HP calculation
- Possible fix for MathJax "Typesetting Failed" errors
- There was an issue with Corporations decaying their employees to 0 stats, even though the minimum was supposed to be 5. Moved the variable storing the min decay value to corporation constants, and raised it to 10.
- Regenerated documentation at https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md due to corporation changes related to min decay stats.
- Faction XP was unintentionally providing 20x the experience gain as it did prior to v2.0. This caused faction work to exceed gym/university as the optimal way to gain experience. Values have been reduced to only about 2x what they were prior to v2.0, and they are no longer better than gym/university.
- Fixed an issue where the overview skill bars could be displayed inaccurately based on player multipliers.

## v2.2.0 - Jan 2 2023 Development Reboot

Dev notes

- The previous main developer, hydroflame, is stepping back from this project for the foreseeable future. To facilitate this, we've moved the repo to a new location at https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src.
- Sorry for the large number of API breaks in this version. To ease the pain here, attempting to use any of the removed functions will provide an error guiding you to the new replacement function to use instead.

BREAKING API CHANGES:

- No longer applicable as of v2.2.1! (ns2 only) ns functions use the 'this' value from ns: if you move the function to its own variable off of ns, it needs to be bound to ns. The internal changes that make this necessary led to very large performance gains for running many scripts at once. e.g.:

  const tprint1 = ns.tprint; // This doesn't work and will error out when calling tprint1();

  const tprint = ns.tprint.bind(ns); // This works because the 'this' value is preserved.

- ns.getPlayer no longer provides properties tor, inBladeburner, or hasCorporation. This information can be looked up using standlone functions: ns.hasTorRouter(), ns.bladeburner.inBladeburner(), ns.corporation.hasCorporation().
- Removed many functions, with replacement ways to get the same info.

  - getServerRam: use getServerMaxRam and getServerUsedRam instead.
  - corporation.assignJob: use setAutoJobAssignment instead.
  - corporation.getEmployee: No longer available (employees are not individual objects).
  - corporation.getExpandCityCost: use ns.corporation.getConstants().officeInitialCost
  - corporation.getExpandIndustryCost: use getIndustryData instead.
  - corporation.getIndustryTypes: use ns.corporation.getConstants().industryNames
  - corporation.getMaterialNames: use ns.corporation.getConstants().materialNames
  - corporation.getPurchaseWarehouseCost: use ns.corporation.getConstants().warehouseInitialCost
  - corporation.getResearchNames: use ns.corporation.getConstants().researchNames
  - corporation.getUnlockables: use ns.corporation.getConstants().unlockNames
  - corporation.getUpgradeNames: use ns.corporation.getConstants().upgradeNames
  - formulas.work.classGains: split into universityGains and gymGains
  - singularity.getAugmentationCost: use getAugmentationPrice and getAugmentationRepReq instead
  - sleeve.getSleeveStats: use getSleeve instead
  - sleeve.getInformation: use getSleeve instead

- An error dialog will inform the player of the above API changes if the player tries to use one of the removed functions above.
- enums.toast was renamed ToastVariant to provide consistency with internal code.

- codingcontract.attempt always returns a string (empty string for a failed attempt). This may break player code if a direct boolean comparison (e.g. 'attemptResult === true') was being made. The string can be used directly as the conditional, because empty string evaluates to false as a boolean.

- corporation.getCorporation().divisions now returns an array of division names, instead of division objects. Use corporation.getDivision(name) to get the division info object.

## v2.1.0 - 2022-09-23 Remote File API

Dev note

- The most important change about this update is the introduction of the Remote File API (RFA).
  With this we also deprecate the HTTP file API and the Visual Studio extension. Those things
  were made during the rush of Steam and aren't well thought out. This new process works with
  both the web and Steam version of the game and every text editor. Moving forward we also
  won't be doing much, if any, upgrades to the in-game editor. We think it's good enough for
  now and if you need more we recommend you hook up your favorite external editor.

## v2.0.0 - 2022-07-19 Work rework

API break rewards

- Everyone is awarded 10 NFG.
- All work in progress program is auto completed.
- All work in progress crafting is auto completed without adding entropy.

  Work (Create program / Work for faction / Studying / etc ...)

- Working has been rebuilt from the grounds up. The motivation for that change is that all
  different types of work all required different cached variables on the main Player object.
  This caused a lot of bugs and crashes. It's been reworked in such a way as to prevent bugs
  and make it nearly trivial to add new kinds of work. However, since this caused a few API break
  I've decided to mark this version following semver protocols and call it 2.0.0
- Crime can be unfocused and auto loops, no more spam clicking.
- All work type give their reward immediately. No need to stop work to bank rewards like reputation.
- Faction and Company work no longer have a time limit.
- Company work no longer reduces rep gain by half for quitting early.
- Company faction require 400k rep to join (from 200k)
- Backdooring company server reduces faction requirement to 300k.
- All work generally no longer keep track of cumulative gains like exp and reputation since it's applied instantly.
- getPlayer returns way less fields but does return the new 'currentWork' field, some fields are moved around.

API breaks

- workForCompany argument 'companyName' is now not-optional
- commitCrime now has 'focus' optional parameter
- using getScriptIncome to get total income has been separated to getTotalScriptIncome.
- using getScriptExpGain to get total income has been separated to getTotalScriptExpGain.
- scp has it's 2 last argument reversed, the signature is now (files, destination, optional_source)
- ns.connect and other singularity function are no longer available at the top level.
  They were already hidden from documentation but now they're gone.
- stock.buy and stock.sell were renamed to stock.buyStock and stock.sellStock because 'buy' and 'sell'
  are very common tokens.
- corporation.bribe no longer allows to give shares as bribe.

  Netscript

- Add singularity.getCurrentWork
- Add singularity.getAugmentationBasePrice
- Add sleeve.getSleeveAugmentationPrice
- Add sleeve.getSleeveAugmentationRepReq
- Fix infiltration.getInfiltrationLocations
- Singularity.goToLocation support for non-city-specific locations (@Ansopedian)
- All corporation functions are synchronous. Job assignment only works on the following cycle. (@stalefishies)
- Add batch functionality to NS spendHashes API (@undeemiss)
- Fix #3661 Add missing memory property to Sleeve API (@borisflagell)
- FIX#3732 Cannot assign two sleeve on "Take on contracts" regardless of contract type. (@borisflagell)

  Corporation

- Dividend fixes and exposing dividends info via scripts (@stalefishies)
- Add big number format support in some Corporation's modal (@borisflagell)
- Fix #3261 Industry overview number formatting (@violet)

  Multipliers

- The main player object was also plagues with a million fields all called '\*\_mult'. Representing the different multipliers
- These have been refactored in a field called 'mults'.

  Misc.

- #3596 Enhanced terminal command parsing (@RevanProdigalKnight)
- Fix #3366 Sleeve UI would sometimes displays the wrong stat while working out. (@borisflagell)
- Two new encryption themed contracts - caesar and vigenere (@Markus-D-M)

- FIX #3514 Clear recently killed tab on BN end event (@Daniel-Barbera)
- HammingCodes description and implementation fixes (@s2ks)
- FIX #3794 Sleeve were getting less shocked when hospitalized (was positive, should have detrimental) (@borisflagell)
- Fix #3803 Servers can no longer have duplicate IPs (@crimsonhawk47)
- Fix #3854 ctrl+c does not clear terminal input (@evil-tim)
- Nerf noodle bar, obviously.
