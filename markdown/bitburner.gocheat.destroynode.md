## GoCheat.destroyNode() method

Attempts to destroy an empty node, leaving an offline dead space that does not count as territory or provide open node access to adjacent routers.

Success chance can be seen via ns.go.getCheatSuccessChance()

Warning: if you fail to play a cheat move, your turn will be skipped. After your first cheat attempt, if you fail, there is a small (\~10%) chance you will instantly be ejected from the subnet.

  }>;
```
